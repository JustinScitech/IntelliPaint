This website is an AI-powered art generator that uses the MERN stack, Tailwind CSS, Cloudinary, and the OpenAI API to produce stunning and unique digital artwork. With a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options, you can create high-quality images that resemble real-world art pieces or abstract works.

## How it works

- Built using React and Tailwind CSS to design the front-end components
- Build the backend using MongoDB with the aid of Cloudinary to store user generated images
- Utilizes the OpenAI API to generate drawings

With IntelliPaint, you'll be able to see your ideas come to life through drawings, paintings, and art!
